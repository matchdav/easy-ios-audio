easy-ios-audio
==============

A small helper class for audio.  Makes it possible to just drop your files into your Xcode project and play them with a simple function call.  The class will find all your audio files and register them, so that all you need to do is ask the player to play the file by its name.  Supports fadeins and fadeouts.

Dependencies: Make sure you include AVFoundation in your project.

To do: Document the API and make a wiki.
